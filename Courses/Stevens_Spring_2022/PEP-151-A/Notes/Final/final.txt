<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Final Questions>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

--------------------------------------------

1. Why do we have seasons?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The tilt of the Earth's axis 

As the earth spins on its axis, producing 
night and day, it also moves about the sun 
in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit 
that requires about 365 1/4 days to 
complete. The earth's spin axis is tilted 
with respect to its orbital plane. This is 
what causes the seasons. 

--------------------------------------------

2. How does the eccentricity of the Earth’s 
orbit affect the seasons?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Seasons last slightly shorter/longer 
in different hemispheres

Eccentricity is the reason why our seasons 
are slightly different lengths, with summers 
in the Northern Hemisphere currently about 
4.5 days longer than winters, and springs 
about three days longer than autumns. As 
eccentricity decreases, the length of our 
seasons gradually evens out. 

Orbital mechanics require that the duration 
of the seasons be proportional to the area 
of Earth's orbit swept between the 
solstices and equinoxes, so when the 
orbital eccentricity is extreme,
[The seasons that occur on the far side of 
the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially 
longer in duration]

--------------------------------------------

3. Are there any appreciable seasons on 
Jupiter – and why?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: No - it doesn't have a large tilt

Jupiter does not have changing seasons like 
the Earth, but instead is believed to have 
a constantly stormy atmosphere. This is 
partly due to its tilt, which is only 3 
degrees. The planet has a very turbulent 
atmosphere and is believed to have a lot 
of long-term storms. Its core is even 
hotter than the sun! 

Jupiter is a lot less tilted than the 
Earth is - only 3 degrees! Add that to its 
very long orbit, and you get seasons that 
last THREE YEARS. But because of the gases 
in its atmosphere, there can be different 
seasons in different spots. Some clouds 
are freezing, while other ones are 
comfortably warm. 

--------------------------------------------

4. What About Uranus? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Not due to its tilt, but only its 
orbit

[Uranus has 4 appreciable seasons and they 
are extremely long, due to the fact that the 
axis of the tilt is 98 degrees, with respect 
to the north direction.]  

During winter, the poles are pointed away 
from the sun. During summer, the sun shines 
directly facing the poles. These seasons 
last for 21 years each. In spring and fall, 
the rotational axis is oriented in such a 
way that the rays of the sun fall directly 
on the equatorial region of the planet. 

Uranus has a relatively circular orbit, so 
it remains at about the same distance from 
the Sun throughout its long year. But the 
axis of Uranus is tilted by 98 degrees! 
This causes 21-year-long seasons and 
unusual weather, although one thing that 
is certain: it is always cold. 

--------------------------------------------

5. Kepler’s third law states that ___
--------------------------------------------

ANS: T^2=Kr^3 (the square of an orbit's 
time is proportional to the cube of the 
radius between the sun and the planet) 

Kepler's Third Law: the squares of the 
orbital periods of the planets are directly 
proportional to the cubes of the semi-major 
axes of their orbits. (p^2 = a^3) 

Kepler's Third Law implies that the period 
for a planet to orbit the Sun increases 
rapidly with the radius of its orbit. 

--------------------------------------------

6. What methods can be used to discover 
planets around other stars?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Radial velocity, gravitational 
microlensing 

The first method is Doppler effect method, 
which measures the speed of a star, either 
toward or away from us. 

The second method is more indirect, is based 
on the slight dimming of a star when one of 
its planet's crosses over the face of the 
star. 

--------------------------------------------

7. An astronomer from a distant star is 
observing the Sun exactly in the orbital 
plane of Jupiter (so that Jupiter crosses 
the solar disk); plot schematically the 
brightness of the Sun they would observe 
during a 25 (Earth) years period.

Since orbital period of Jupiter is ~= 12 
years, monitoring sun for 50 years will 
give periodic peaks in intensity. 

--------------------------------------------

8. How do we measure the age of the Earth 
(i.e. the age of the oldest rocks)? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Dating radioactive elements in it

The ages of Earth and Moon rocks and of 
meteorites are measured by the decay of 
long-lived radioactive isotopes of elements 
that occur naturally in rocks and minerals 
and that decay with half lives of 700 
million to more than 100 billion years to 
stable isotopes of other elements. 

[
- One way to estimate the age of a planet 
is by counting the number of impact 
craters. 

- The best method is to measure the age of 
the individual rocks using radioactivity 
(radioactive decay).
] 

--------------------------------------------

9. How does the age of Earth compare with 
the age of the Universe? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It is very young 

Current measurements yield an age of about 
4.54 billion years for the Earth and about 
13.8 billion years for the Universe. 

--------------------------------------------

10. Why the chemical composition of solar 
system implies it was formed from the 
remnants of older stars? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Heavier elements are in newer solar 
systems 

Milky way was younger, did not contain many 
heavy elements like iron. However, star 
Kepler-444 formed when the Milky Way was 2 
billions old. heavier elements that were 
needed for planets to form were available 
then. supernova, which allowed the heavy 
elements to disperse (solar system) forms. 

--------------------------------------------

11. What is the solar cycle (magnetic, 
and sunspot number)?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The magnetism flips every 11 years; 
indicated by a rise in sunspots

The 11-year sunspot cycle is actually half 
of a longer, 22-year cycle of solar 
activity. Each time the sunspot count rises 
and falls, the magnetic field of the Sun 
associated with sunspots reverses polarity; 
the orientation of magnetic fields in the 
Sun's northern and southern hemispheres 
switch. 

[The solar cycle is a 11 year periodic 
cycle, which occurs when the Sun's magnetic 
field reverses polarity, and it is measured 
by the number of sunspots.] 

--------------------------------------------

12. How does polarity of the solar magnetic 
poles change during the solar cycle?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It flips every 11 years 

The sun's magnetic field changes polarity 
approximately every 11 years. It happens at 
the peak of each solar cycle as the sun's 
inner magnetic dynamo re-organizes itself. 
The coming reversal will mark the midpoint 
of Solar Cycle 24. Half of "solar max" will 
be behind us, with half yet to come. 

[Sunspots are in pairs, the leading spot of 
pairs in the Northern Hemisphere all had the 
same magnetic polarity, and the leading 
spot of pairs in the Southern Hemisphere 
all have opposite magnetic polarity. In the 
next solar cycle, the polarity of the 
leading spots in each hemisphere is 
reversed.] 

--------------------------------------------

13. How do we know there is strong magnetic 
field in the sunspots?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The magnetic field inhibits convection 
to the surface, resulting in a darker spot

We know that sunspots are magnetic because 
we can directly observe the effect that the 
field has on the spectral lines we observe 
through a phenomenon called the Zeeman 
effect. 

[Spectral lines which measured on sunspots 
are split which indicated that there is a 
strong magnetic field.] 

--------------------------------------------

14. What is the HR diagram? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Luminosity vs temperature. Two stars 
with the same temperature but different 
luminosities must be different sizes. 

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, also called 
H-R diagram, in astronomy, graph in which 
the absolute magnitudes (intrinsic 
brightness) of stars are plotted against 
their spectral types (temperatures). 

--------------------------------------------

15. What is the main characteristic of the 
stars on the main sequence?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: They all use fusion (hydrogen to 
helium)

Main sequence stars are characterised by the 
source of their energy. They are all 
undergoing fusion of hydrogen into helium 
within their cores. The rate at which they 
do this and the amount of fuel available 
depends upon the mass of the star. 

[Main sequence stars spend 90% of its life 
fusing hydrogen in its core into helium. 
Large stars have large nuclear fusions, 
and they shine with greatest luminosity/
surface temperatures.] 

--------------------------------------------

16. What is the spectral class of the Sun, 
and what is the meaning of 'V' in it? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: G2 V. V means main sequence; G 
indicates temperature

The full classification for our Sun is G2 V. 
The G2 spectral type means it is 
yellow-white in color and the luminosity 
class V means it a hydrogen-burning, 
main-sequence star. 

--------------------------------------------

17. How is the HR diagram of an old star 
cluster different from a young one?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Young clusters include hotter, bluer, 
more powerful stars 

Young Clusters (within the span of 3 
million years) : i. massive stars evolve 
faster than less massive stars. After 
reaching the main sequence, and using up the 
hydrogen in their core, massive stars become 
red giants. As time passes for less massive 
stars, they begin to steer off the main 
sequence and move to the upper right side of 
the H-R diagram. 

For H.R Diagrams of Older Clusters (after 4 
billion years): i. The oldest clusters out 
of all are the globular clusters. Most 
stars, leave the main sequence; and on low 
mass stars remain at the bottom of the main 
sequence. The older the cluster, the lower 
the point is on the main sequence where 
stars begin to head towards the red giant 
region. 

--------------------------------------------

18. What keeps the main sequence stars from 
gravitational collapse? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Fusion expands the star outward, 
counteracting gravity 

Stars on the main sequence are those that 
are fusing hydrogen into helium in their 
cores. The radiation and heat from this 
reaction keep the force of gravity from 
collapsing the star during this phase of 
the star's life. 

--------------------------------------------

19. White dwarf is the final product of 
_____ and what stops a white dwarf from 
collapsing further? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: A white dwarf is the final stage of 
the evolution of a star that is between .07 
and 1.4 solar masses. Supported by electron 
degeneracy 

Stars/Matter is subjected to very high 
pressure and temperature, it condenses to 
an extent where electrons can no longer 
condense any further. Therefore, degeneracy 
pressure of the electrons prevents the white 
dwarfs from collapsing. 

--------------------------------------------

20. What is the maximum mass of a white 
dwarf? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: 1.4 solar masses 

--------------------------------------------

21. A neutron star is ____ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The remains of a star that died in a 
massive star supernova (if no black hole was 
created) 

A small, highly dense star composed almost 
entirely of tightly packed neutrons; radius 
about 10km 

--------------------------------------------

22. Why do neutron stars rotate so quickly?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Conservation of Angular momentum 

Neutron stars rotate extremely rapidly 
after their formation due to the 
conservation of angular momentum; in analogy 
to spinning ice skaters pulling in their 
arms, the slow rotation of the original 
star's core speeds up as it shrinks. A 
newborn neutron star can rotate many times 
a second. 

--------------------------------------------

23. How did we discover neutron stars? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Observing a sudden, bright distant 
light 

British astronomer Antony Hewish (1924–) 
and British astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell 
(1943–) discovered the first reported 
neutron star in 1967 when they detected 
radio pulses coming from what they thought 
was a pulsar. 

--------------------------------------------

24. Will the Sun ever be a neutron star, 
and why/why not? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: No - not large enough 

--------------------------------------------

25. An event horizon is ____ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The edge of a black hole 

the outer boundary of a black hole, where 
escape velocity is speed of light, and an 
object can no longer interact with the of 
the universe. 

--------------------------------------------

26. How and why does the shape of object 
approaching the black hole change? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It elongates 

As the object falls into the black hole, 
tidal forces will rip the object apart so 
that it stretches out like a piece of 
spaghetti in a process aptly named 
spaghettification. 

--------------------------------------------

27. A supernova is ______ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Final stage in the life of a giant 
star 

A supernova is what happens when a star has 
reached the end of its life and explodes in 
a brilliant burst of light (For a short 
period of time). 

--------------------------------------------

28. Describe the differences of the two 
main types of supernovae by their origin 
and their spectrum. 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Type I is a binary star system with a 
white dwarf that steals matter from its 
partner. Type II leaves a neutron star

[Type I supernovae does not have hydrogen 
absorption lines in their spectrum whereas 
Type II supernovae has hydrogen absorption 
lines in their spectrum.] 

--------------------------------------------

29. Which of the two types of SN you 
described above is useful for the distance 
determination, and why? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Type I are more luminous (brighter) 

--------------------------------------------

30. How do we measure distances to the 
nearby galaxies, such as M31 (Andromeda 
galaxy)? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Light curves

Distances to deep-sky objects such as the 
Andromeda galaxy are often determined using 
what are referred to as "Standard Candles", 
which means that astronomers look for objects 
located within the target for which they 
believe they know the intrinsic luminosity 
(how bright it actually is). 

[Standard candle method or the Cepheid 
variables --> Hubble measured the distance 
to the Andromeda galaxy using this, which 
measures distance in our galaxy and nearby 
galaxies.] 

--------------------------------------------

structure of the Milky Way and indicate the 
position of the solar system.

Motion of the elliptical galaxies are
predominantly radial. Spiral galaxies 
rotate with spiral arms trailing 

--------------------------------------------

32. What are the two main morphological 
types of galaxies, and what is the 
difference in their rotation patterns? 
--------------------------------------------

- Spiral galaxies, the stars and emission 
nebulae make the spiral arms stand out like 
a pinwheel.

- For elliptical galaxies, their rotation 
has a radial motion in a sense where they 
don't rotate systematically like spiral 
galaxies do (looks like star light center) 

--------------------------------------------

33. What is the difference between the two 
galaxy types you described above regarding 
the color? 
--------------------------------------------

Elliptical (red and yellow) 

Spiral (blue) 

--------------------------------------------

34. What is the main difference between the 
same two galaxy types above regarding the 
age of stars? 35. Are the last two 
questions related in any way?
--------------------------------------------

- Spiral galaxies consist of a mixture of 
young and old stars. The young stars are 
present in the spiral arms, which indicates 
that new star formation is happening. 

- Elliptical galaxies consist mostly old 
stars with shapes that are spheres or 
ellipsoids. 

--------------------------------------------

36. Hubble's law says that _____ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Galaxies further from us are moving 
faster away... V = H (constant)*d 

Galaxies are moving away from the Earth at 
speeds proportional to their distance. In 
other words, the farther they are the faster 
they are moving away from Earth. 

--------------------------------------------

37. How can the radial velocity of stars 
and galaxies be measured? 
--------------------------------------------

To measure the radial velocity, you obtain 
a spectrum of the star and you measure the 
wavelength of a number of spectrum lines. 

Using the Doppler shift of the star's 
spectrum, astronomers can measure the 
radial velocity. It measures by wavelengths 
of absorption lines in its spectrum. 

--------------------------------------------

38. Describe the cosmic distance ladder. 
--------------------------------------------

Measure vast distances... For example, 
once astronomers measure the distance to a 
galaxy using one rung, they can then 
measure the distance using the next rung 
and match the two. 

--------------------------------------------

39. Naively interpreting Hubble's law, one 
may conclude that we are in the center of 
the expansion, and therefore in the center 
of the Universe. Is that so? Explain. 
--------------------------------------------

Galaxies are expanding in space and space 
expanding, which doesn't place us in the 
center of the Universe. It's also possible 
that the Universe doesn't have a center, 
since literally all objects are moving away 
from other objects. 

--------------------------------------------

40. If you were to apply Kepler's third law 
to the stars orbiting in the Galactic disk 
and halo (naively assuming that most mass 
resides in the visible stars), sketch out 
how approximately the velocity vs. distance 
from the center curve would look like. 

41. What does the actually observed orbital 
speed vs. distance curve look like? Is it 
different from what's expected from 
Keplerian behavior? If so, why?

 --------------------------------- Distance 

Mass is supposed to decrease, but it does 
not when observed. 

--------------------------------------------

42. Why do we think there is such a thing 
as dark matter? 
--------------------------------------------

Scientists are confident it exists because 
of the gravitational effects it appears to 
have on galaxies and galaxy clusters. 

Dark matter does not emit or absorb light. 
It is still hard to even detect what it is 
made of. 

--------------------------------------------

43. What is the cosmic microwave background 
(CMB)? 
--------------------------------------------

CMB is a radiation that is a remnant from 
the Big Bang and that fills the entire 
Universe. 

--------------------------------------------

44. What significant event after the Big 
Bang is related to the appearance of the 
CMB? 
--------------------------------------------

The fusion of helium and lithium happened 
4 minutes after the Universe was born and 
the first nuclei were born. 

The cosmic microwave background (CMB), 
is radiation that fills the universe and 
can be detected in every direction. 
Microwaves are invisible to the naked eye 
so that cannot be seen without instruments. 
It created shortly after the universe came 
into being in the Big Bang, the CMB 
represents the earliest radiation that can 
be detected. 

--------------------------------------------

45. Was the CMB always radiating in the 
microwave part of the spectrum? 
--------------------------------------------

It's possible at one point the CMB was 
radiating in the infrared part of the 
spectrum....The original temperature was 
10^7 K when CMB was emitted. the temperature 
dropped to 3000 K. According to Wien's law 
that correlates wavelength and temperature, 
the expansion lowered the temperature by a 
factor of 1000. 

--------------------------------------------

46. What is cosmic inflation, and what are 
the problems that inflation resolves? 
--------------------------------------------

- Expansion of the early universe that was 
faster than light led to the creation of 
universe. 

- There was enough time for the universe to 
reach the same temperature it is today and 
expand all regions. 

- Another thing it solves is that the 
Universe's density should equal to critical 
density.
