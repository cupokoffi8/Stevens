<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Final Questions>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

--------------------------------------------

1. Why do we have seasons?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The tilt of the Earth's axis 

As the earth spins on its axis, producing 
night and day, it also moves about the sun 
in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit 
that requires about 365 1/4 days to 
complete. The earth's spin axis is tilted 
with respect to its orbital plane. This is 
what causes the seasons. 

--------------------------------------------

2. How does the eccentricity of the Earth’s 
orbit affect the seasons?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Seasons last slightly shorter/longer 
in different hemispheres

Eccentricity is the reason why our seasons 
are slightly different lengths, with summers 
in the Northern Hemisphere currently about 
4.5 days longer than winters, and springs 
about three days longer than autumns. As 
eccentricity decreases, the length of our 
seasons gradually evens out. 

Orbital mechanics require that the duration 
of the seasons be proportional to the area 
of Earth's orbit swept between the 
solstices and equinoxes, so when the 
orbital eccentricity is extreme,
[The seasons that occur on the far side of 
the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially 
longer in duration]

--------------------------------------------

3. Are there any appreciable seasons on 
Jupiter – and why?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: No - it doesn't have a large tilt

Jupiter does not have changing seasons like 
the Earth, but instead is believed to have 
a constantly stormy atmosphere. This is 
partly due to its tilt, which is only 3 
degrees. The planet has a very turbulent 
atmosphere and is believed to have a lot 
of long-term storms. Its core is even 
hotter than the sun! 

Jupiter is a lot less tilted than the 
Earth is - only 3 degrees! Add that to its 
very long orbit, and you get seasons that 
last THREE YEARS. But because of the gases 
in its atmosphere, there can be different 
seasons in different spots. Some clouds 
are freezing, while other ones are 
comfortably warm. 

--------------------------------------------

4. What About Uranus? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Not due to its tilt, but only its 
orbit

During winter, the poles are pointed away 
from the sun. During summer, the sun shines 
directly facing the poles. These seasons 
last for 21 years each. In spring and fall, 
the rotational axis is oriented in such a 
way that the rays of the sun fall directly 
on the equatorial region of the planet. 

Uranus has a relatively circular orbit, so 
it remains at about the same distance from 
the Sun throughout its long year. But the 
axis of Uranus is tilted by 98 degrees! 
This causes 21-year-long seasons and 
unusual weather, although one thing that 
is certain: it is always cold. 

--------------------------------------------

5. Kepler’s third law states that ___
--------------------------------------------

ANS: T^2=Kr^3 (the square of an orbit's 
time is proportional to the cube of the 
radius between the sun and the planet) 

Kepler's Third Law: the squares of the 
orbital periods of the planets are directly 
proportional to the cubes of the semi-major 
axes of their orbits. (p^2 = a^3) 

Kepler's Third Law implies that the period 
for a planet to orbit the Sun increases 
rapidly with the radius of its orbit. 

--------------------------------------------

6. What methods can be used to discover 
planets around other stars?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Radial velocity, gravitational 
microlensing 

The vast majority of planets around other 
stars have been found through the transit 
method so far. This technique involves 
monitoring the amount of light that a star 
gives off over time, and looking for dips 
in brightness that may indicate an orbiting 
planet passing in front of the star. 

NASA has two specialized exoplanet-hunting 
telescopes scanning the sky for new planets 
right now -- Kepler and the Transiting 
Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) -- and 
they both work this way. Other methods of 
finding exoplanets include radial velocity 
(looking for a “wobble” in a star's 
position caused by a planet’s gravity), 
direct imaging (blocking the light of the 
star to see the planet) and microlensing 
(watching for events where a star passes in 
front of another star, and the gravity of 
the first star acts as a lens). 

--------------------------------------------

7. An astronomer from a distant star is 
observing the Sun exactly in the orbital 
plane of Jupiter (so that Jupiter crosses 
the solar disk); plot schematically the 
brightness of the Sun they would observe 
during a 25 (Earth) years period.

Since orbital period of Jupiter is ~= 12 
years, monitoring sun for 50 years will 
give periodic peaks in intensity. 

--------------------------------------------

8. How do we measure the age of the Earth 
(i.e. the age of the oldest rocks)? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Dating radioactive elements in it

The ages of Earth and Moon rocks and of 
meteorites are measured by the decay of 
long-lived radioactive isotopes of elements 
that occur naturally in rocks and minerals 
and that decay with half lives of 700 
million to more than 100 billion years to 
stable isotopes of other elements. 

--------------------------------------------

9. How does the age of Earth compare with 
the age of the Universe? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It is very young 

Current measurements yield an age of about 
4.54 billion years for the Earth and about 
13.8 billion years for the Universe. 

--------------------------------------------

10. Why the chemical composition of solar 
system implies it was formed from the 
remnants of older stars? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Heavier elements are in newer solar 
systems 

The presence of the heavier elements in 
our solar system tells us that the solar 
system was formed from the remnants of older 
stars. All the elements which are heavier 
than nickel are formed in a supernova 
explosion. Hence, the presence of the heavier 
elements shows that supernova did happened 
before the beginning of the solar system. 
The supernova happens when star dies and 
goes out into big explosion. Also, the 
presence of certain isotopes of different 
element shows that certain material were 
injected by the supernova that lead to the 
change in the number of neutrons in the 
nucleus of certain elements. 

--------------------------------------------

11. What is the solar cycle (magnetic, 
and sunspot number)?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The magnetism flips every 11 years; 
indicated by a rise in sunspots

The 11-year sunspot cycle is actually half 
of a longer, 22-year cycle of solar activity. 
Each time the sunspot count rises and falls, 
the magnetic field of the Sun associated with 
sunspots reverses polarity; the orientation 
of magnetic fields in the Sun's northern and 
southern hemispheres switch. 

--------------------------------------------

12. How does polarity of the solar magnetic 
poles change during the solar cycle?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It flips every 11 years 

The sun's magnetic field changes polarity 
approximately every 11 years. It happens at 
the peak of each solar cycle as the sun's 
inner magnetic dynamo re-organizes itself. 
The coming reversal will mark the midpoint 
of Solar Cycle 24. Half of "solar max" will 
be behind us, with half yet to come. 

--------------------------------------------

13. How do we know there is strong magnetic 
field in the sunspots?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The magnetic field inhibits convection 
to the surface, resulting in a darker spot

We know that sunspots are magnetic because 
we can directly observe the effect that the 
field has on the spectral lines we observe 
through a phenomenon called the Zeeman 
effect. 

--------------------------------------------

14. What is the HR diagram? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Luminosity vs temperature. Two stars 
with the same temperature but different 
luminosities must be different sizes. 

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, also called 
H-R diagram, in astronomy, graph in which 
the absolute magnitudes (intrinsic 
brightness) of stars are plotted against 
their spectral types (temperatures). 

--------------------------------------------

15. What is the main characteristic of the 
stars on the main sequence?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: They all use fusion (hydrogen to 
helium)

Main sequence stars are characterised by the 
source of their energy. They are all 
undergoing fusion of hydrogen into helium 
within their cores. The rate at which they 
do this and the amount of fuel available 
depends upon the mass of the star. 

--------------------------------------------

16. What is the spectral class of the Sun, 
and what is the meaning of 'V' in it? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: G2 V. V means main sequence; G 
indicates temperature

The full classification for our Sun is G2 V. 
The G2 spectral type means it is 
yellow-white in color and the luminosity 
class V means it a hydrogen-burning, 
main-sequence star. 

--------------------------------------------

17. How is the HR diagram of an old star 
cluster different from a young one?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Young clusters include hotter, bluer, 
more powerful stars 

When a cluster is young, the brightest 
members are O, B and A stars. Young clusters 
in our Galaxy are called open clusters due 
to their loose appearance. They usually 
contain between 100 and 1,000 members. 

Early in the formation of our Galaxy, very 
large, globular clusters formed from giant 
molecular clouds. Each contain over 10,000 
members, appear very compact and have the 
oldest stars in the Universe. 

--------------------------------------------

18. What keeps the main sequence stars from 
gravitational collapse? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Fusion expands the star outward, 
counteracting gravity 

Stars on the main sequence are those that 
are fusing hydrogen into helium in their 
cores. The radiation and heat from this 
reaction keep the force of gravity from 
collapsing the star during this phase of 
the star's life. 

--------------------------------------------

19. White dwarf is the final product of 
_____ and what stops a white dwarf from 
collapsing further? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: A white dwarf is the final stage of 
the evolution of a star that is between .07 
and 1.4 solar masses. Supported by electron 
degeneracy 

--------------------------------------------

20. What is the maximum mass of a white 
dwarf? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: 1.4 solar masses 

--------------------------------------------

21. A neutron star is ____ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The remains of a star that died in a 
massive star supernova (if no black hole was 
created) 

A small, highly dense star composed almost 
entirely of tightly packed neutrons; radius 
about 10km 

--------------------------------------------

22. Why do neutron stars rotate so quickly?
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Angular momentum 

Neutron stars rotate extremely rapidly 
after their formation due to the 
conservation of angular momentum; in analogy 
to spinning ice skaters pulling in their 
arms, the slow rotation of the original 
star's core speeds up as it shrinks. A 
newborn neutron star can rotate many times 
a second. 

--------------------------------------------

23. How did we discover neutron stars? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Observing a sudden, bright distant 
light 

British astronomer Antony Hewish (1924–) 
and British astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell 
(1943–) discovered the first reported 
neutron star in 1967 when they detected 
radio pulses coming from what they thought 
was a pulsar. 

--------------------------------------------

24. Will the Sun ever be a neutron star, 
and why/why not? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: No - not large enough 

--------------------------------------------

25. An event horizon is ____ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: The edge of a black hole 

In astrophysics, an event horizon is a 
boundary beyond which events cannot affect 
an observer. Wolfgang Rindler coined the 
term in the 1950s. In 1784, John Michell 
proposed that gravity can be strong enough 
in the vicinity of massive compact objects 
that even light cannot escape. 

--------------------------------------------

26. How and why does the shape of object 
approaching the black hole change? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: It elongates 

As the object falls into the black hole, 
tidal forces will rip the object apart so 
that it stretches out like a piece of 
spaghetti in a process aptly named 
spaghettification. 

--------------------------------------------

27. A supernova is ______ 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Final stage in the life of a giant 
star 

A supernova is what happens when a star has 
reached the end of its life and explodes in 
a brilliant burst of light. 

--------------------------------------------

28. Describe the differences of the two 
main types of supernovae by their origin 
and their spectrum. 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Type I is a binary star system with a 
white dwarf that steals matter from its 
partner. Type II leaves a neutron star

As the earth spins on its axis, producing 
night and day, it also moves about the sun 
in an elliptical (elongated circle) orbit 
that requires about 365 1/4 days to 
complete. The earth's spin axis is tilted 
with respect to its orbital plane. This is 
what causes the seasons. 

--------------------------------------------

29. Which of the two types of SN you 
described above is useful for the distance 
determination, and why? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Type II are more luminous 

--------------------------------------------

30. How do we measure distances to the 
nearby galaxies, such as M31 (Andromeda 
galaxy)? 
--------------------------------------------

ANS: Light curves

Distances to deep-sky objects such as the 
Andromeda galaxy are often determined using 
what are referred to as "Standard Candles", 
which means that astronomers look for objects 
located within the target for which they 
believe they know the intrinsic luminosity 
(how bright it actually is).
