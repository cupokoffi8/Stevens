# Assignment 3

# Problem/Question:

- Problem1:

  - Design a function that can read an array from the user
  - Design a function that can print the entered array
  - Design a function that can print the array in reverse order
  - Design a function that can print only the odd elements of the user array

- Problem2:
  - Write a class for complex number called Complex. In this class you will initial complex number, print, perform addition,
    subtraction, and multiplication.
    You will also overload operator <<, and +, and use the friend function

## TO-DO:

- clone your repo to your local computer
  - ''' <b>git clone repo_https_url</b> '''
  - repo https url is found under code tab in your github
- Edit your name on top on README.md file.
- Edit the main function (file name: main.cpp) for problem one only and read it to understand the calling of functions
  - follow instruction in main.cpp for each problem
- Edit files in src folder, <b>ONLY</b>:

  - functionArray.cpp
  - classComplex.cpp
  - Each file have the coded prototype for the function to start writing your code.

- Push your answers
  - use git in your terminal to add files, and add comments on your commits, and finally submit files
    - ''' <b>git add specific_file1.x specific_file2.x</b> '''
    - ''' <b>git commit -m "add message here for commits"</b> '''
    - ''' <b>git push</b> '''
