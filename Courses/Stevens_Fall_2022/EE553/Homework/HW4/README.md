# Assignment 4


# Problem/Question:
- Problem:
  - design class (constructor, functions, and main function) to perform the following tasks:
    1. customized constructor takes year, month, date, hour, min, sec
    2. calc_juliandate() method that convert the user provided date (year, month, day, hour, min, sec) for example (2007,2,8,0,0,1) to JulianDate
    3. diff_calc_juliandate that calculate the different between two dates, the different should be in Julian format

  - Calculator of julian date: https://www.aavso.org/jd-calculator
  - Example of the equations are given in: http://www.c-jump.com/bcc/c155c/Homework/a4_Serial_Julian_Date/a4_Serial_Julian_Date.html

  - students are allowed to have some variation on their answers based on the formula used to obtain Julian date

## TO-DO:
  - clone your repo to your local computer
    - ''' <b>git clone repo_https_url</b> '''
    - repo https url is found under code tab in your github
  - Edit your name on top on README.md file.
  - Edit main.cpp file, <b>ONLY</b>:
    - Implement and design your class in main.cpp
    - Please follow the instruction for the class
