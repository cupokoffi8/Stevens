# Assignment 1


# Problem/Question:
 - Problem1: \
    Write C++ code that sum the numbers from 1 to 100
 - Problem2: \
    a. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/1 + 1/2 + … + 1/99 + 1/100)\
    b. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/100 + 1/99 + ... 1/2 + 1/1)\
    compare a and b
 - Problem3: \
    a. Write C++ code that sum multiplication reciprocals (1/(1x1) + 1/(2x2) + … ) \
    b. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/(100x100) + 1/(99x99) + ... )

## TO-DO:
  - clone your repo to your local computer
    - ''' <b>git clone repo_https_url</b> '''
    - repo https url is found under code tab in your github
  - Edit your name on top on README.md file.
  - Only Look at the main function (file name: main.cpp) to understand the calling of functionSum.cpp
  - Edit file in src folder ONLY:
    - functionSum.cpp
    - Each file has the coded prototype for each function to start writing your code.
  - Push your answers or edit directly in GitHub
    - use git in your terminal to add files, and add comments on your commits, and finally submit files
      - ''' <b>git add specific_file1.x specific_file2.x</b> '''
      - ''' <b>git commit -m "add message here for commits"</b> '''
      - ''' <b>git push</b> ''' 
      - [check git website for installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
      - [check this for how to clone and commit changes](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/)
