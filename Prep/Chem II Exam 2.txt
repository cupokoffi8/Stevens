Percent Ionization: [H]/[HA]*100

Another way to measure the strength 
of an acid is to determine the percentage 
of acid molecules that ionize when dissolved 
in water; this is called the percent ionization.

–The higher the percent ionization, 
the stronger the acid.


Strong Bases: 

The stronger the base, the more willing 
it is to accept H+.–Use water as the 
standard acid.

-For ionic bases, like NaOH, practically 
all units are dissociated into OH– and 
cation, Na+.

–Strong electrolytes
–Multi-OH–strong bases completely 
dissociate in one step.


Weak Bases:

In weak bases, only a small fraction of 
molecules accept H+.

–Weak electrolyte
–Most of the weak base molecules do not 
take H+ from water
–Much less than 1% ionization in water


Base Ionization Constant (Kb): 

Base strength is measured by the size of 
the equilibrium constant when it reacts with 
H2O.

B + H2O -> OH− + BH+

The equilibrium constant is called the base 
ionization constant, Kb.

-Larger Kb = stronger base
