Problem 1 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
Explain if thered still be seasons on Earth

a) if Earths axis has no tilt and is 
perfectly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane

[[ If the axis of Earth was not tilted, and 
instead perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, 
there would not be seasons on Earth. Were 
there no tilt along the Earths axis, its 
hemispheres would always be the same 
distance from the sun. As a result, there 
would not be a change in sun exposure in 
different locations throughout the year, 
instead having uniform climates all over the 
Earth. ]];

b) if Earths axis is in the ecliptic plane.[[ If the Earth were tilted 90o, placing its 
axis in the ecliptic plane, it would be 
almost inhabitable due to the harsh seasons. 
However, instead of having four seasons like 
we do with a 23.5o angle, there would only be 
two seasons with respect to the Earths orbit 
around the sun. Each half of the Earth would 
either experience a harsh summer or winter 
cold depending on where the sunlight is 
directed. Also, a day would last an entire 
year at one end of the Earth, while the other 
end would never see daylight. Due to the 
consistent exposure or lack of exposure to 
sunlight depending on which end of the Earth 
you are on, temperatures would be too extreme
for most life, besides maybe bacteria and some
microorganisms. ]];

Problem 2 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
The Sun is about 27,000 light-years away from
the center of our own galaxy. 

a) use the definition of light-year, i.e. 
distance light travels in a year, to convert 
the Suns distance from the galactic center 
from light-years to km. 
[[ Using the fact that light travels at 
approximately 300000000 meters/second it can 
be converted to kilometers/second by simply 
dividing by 1000, yielding 300000 
kilometers/second. Since there are 
[60min*60sec/min] = 3600 seconds in an hour, 
this value can be multiplied by 300000 to give 
us 1080000000 kilometers/hour. We know that 
there are approximately 24 hours in a day, and
365 days a year, allowing us to find the speed 
of light per year by multiplying 
(24)(365)(1080000000) giving us 9460800000000 
kilometers per year. Using the distance in 
kilometers that light travels in a year, the 
distance of 27000 light years can be obtained
by multiplying 9460800000000 by 27000, 
resulting in a distance 255441600000000000 
kilometers. ]]; 

b) use your answer in a) and the fact that 
1AU = 1.5e8 km to figure out how far the Sun 
is from the galactic center in AU. (i.e. can 
think of it roughly as how many Sun-Earth 
system can be packed in between) 

[[ After finding the distance between the Sun 
and the galactic center to be 
255441600000000000 kilometers, this can be 
converted to AU by dividing by 150000000, 
resulting in a distance of 1702944000 AU. ]];

Problem 3 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
For a neutron star whose density is 5e17 
kg/m3,

a) what would the mass of 1 teaspoons worth of 
the material from that neutron star be? You 
can assume the volume of a standard teaspoon
to be 5e-6 m3. 

[[ The mass is proportional to the product of 
the density and given volume: (5e17)*(5e-6) = 
25e11 kg. ]]; 

b) how many empire state buildings (3.3e8 kg) 
would that be? 

[[ Given that the mass in a teaspoon is 25e11 
kg: (25e11)/(3.3e8) = 7575.75 empire state 
buildings. ]];  


--------------------------------------------

Problem 4 (4 points).
--------------------------------------------
In class we learned the difference between 
keeping track of time relative to distant 
stars and relative to the Sun, e.g. sidereal 
day vs. solar day. A tropical year has 365.2422
solar days and 366.2422 sidereal days.

a) What is the length of one sidereal day in 
terms of solar days?

[[ Given that there are 365.2422 solar days and
366.2422 sidereal days in a year, one sidereal
day equates to 365.2422/366.2422=0.9973 solar
days. ]]; 

b) If we know the average solar day is 24 hours
use your answer in a) to figure out the length
of one sidereal day in terms of hours, minutes
and seconds (in the format hh:mm:ss). 

[[ Knowing that the average solar day is 24 
hours: 24 = x/0.9973, x=23.9352hr. 60*0.9352 =
56.112min. 60*0.112 = 6.72sec. Thus, yielding 
23:56:07 for a sidereal day. ]]; 

c) Hypothetically, as part of a project to show
Jupiters apparent motion relative to distant
stars, you took a first photo of Jupiter one 
night at 9:00:00 pm. You want to take a second 
photo the very next night and have all the 
distant stars show up at the same positions in
your photo as the night before (with exactly
the same camera position and orientation), at
what time (in the format hh:mm:ss) should you
take the second photo? 

[[ Knowing 23:56:07 for a sidereal day, if a 
photo were taken at 21:00 of Jupiter with the 
desire of keeping the location of the distant 
stars the same, 23:56:07 would have to pass, 
making the time 08:56:07 p.m. ]];

Problem 5 (5 points).
--------------------------------------------
With the help of the diagram above, answer 
the following for the location of Hoboken 
(latitude = 41 deg): 

a) What is the angle between the zenith and 
the north celestial pole?

[[ An individuals latitude is the altitude of 
their respective celestial pole, so in Hoboken
(North Hemisphere), the North Celestial Pole 
is at an angle of 41o, and zenith is always at 
an angle of 90o. Thus, the angle between zenith
and the NCP is 49o in Hoboken. ]]; 

b) On the day of June solstice, when the sun is
the highest in your local sky, what is the 
angle between the sun and the zenith? 

[[ On the day of the June solstice, the sun is 
located 23.5o above the equator at its highest
point (noon). At solar noon, the zenith angle 
is at a minimum and is equal to latitude minus
solar declination angle, which is at its max on 
the summer solstice, at 23.5o. Thus, at a 
latitude of 41oN, the zenith angle is 41 - 23.5 
= 17.5o ]]; 

c) On the day of March equinox, when the sun is
the highest in your local sky, what is the angle
between the sun and the zenith? 

[[ The sun runs along the celestial equator 
during the March equinox, resulting in the 
zenith angle being equal to the latitude at 
solar noon, which means the angle in Hoboken 
would be 41o ]];

Problem 6 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
a) What is so special about Polaris? Is it 
because it is the brightest star in the sky? 
If your answer is no, then explain why else 
Polaris is special. 

[[ Polaris as we know it today in the 21st 
century is special, but not because it is the 
brightest star in the sky. It is situated at 
the North Celestial Pole (NCP), with Earthâ€™s
axis pointing directly at it. While it will 
not be situated there forever, it allows for 
us to easily keep track of where North is, 
simply by following Polaris. ]]; 

b) Was our north pole pointed at Polaris 
13000 years ago? If not, sketch out the 
orientation of the north pole relative to 
Polaris today and 13000 years ago. 

[[ No, the axis of rotation wobbles over 
time, causing it to point in different 
directions on different time intervals. 
Roughly 13,000 years ago, Vega was the north 
star, and in about 13,000 years, it will once 
again be the north star. ]];

Problem 7 (1 point). 
--------------------------------------------
Do lunar eclipses happen every single month? 
Explain your answer. 

No, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon 
enters the Earth's shadow. They do not happen 
every month because the Earth's orbit around 
the sun is not in the same plane as the Moon's 
orbit around Earth
