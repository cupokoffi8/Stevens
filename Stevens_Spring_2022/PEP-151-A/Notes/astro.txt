Problem 1 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
Explain if thered still be seasons on Earth

a) if Earths axis has no tilt and is 
perfectly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane

[[ If the axis of Earth was not tilted, and 
instead perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, 
there would not be seasons on Earth. Were 
there no tilt along the Earths axis, its 
hemispheres would always be the same 
distance from the sun. As a result, there 
would not be a change in sun exposure in 
different locations throughout the year, 
instead having uniform climates all over the 
Earth. ]];

b) if Earths axis is in the ecliptic plane.[[ If the Earth were tilted 90o, placing its 
axis in the ecliptic plane, it would be 
almost inhabitable due to the harsh seasons. 
However, instead of having four seasons like 
we do with a 23.5o angle, there would only be 
two seasons with respect to the Earths orbit 
around the sun. Each half of the Earth would 
either experience a harsh summer or winter 
cold depending on where the sunlight is 
directed. Also, a day would last an entire 
year at one end of the Earth, while the other 
end would never see daylight. Due to the 
consistent exposure or lack of exposure to 
sunlight depending on which end of the Earth 
you are on, temperatures would be too extreme
for most life, besides maybe bacteria and some
microorganisms. ]];

Problem 2 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
The Sun is about 27,000 light-years away from
the center of our own galaxy. 

a) use the definition of light-year, i.e. 
distance light travels in a year, to convert 
the Suns distance from the galactic center 
from light-years to km. 
[[ Using the fact that light travels at 
approximately 300000000 meters/sec it can 
be converted to kilometers/second by simply 
dividing by 1000, yielding 300000 
kilometers/second. Since there are 
[60min*60sec/min] = 3600 seconds in an hour, 
this value can be multiplied by 300000 to give 
us 1080000000 kilometers/hour. We know that 
there are approximately 24 hours in a day, and
365 days a year, allowing us to find the speed 
of light per year by multiplying 
(24)(365)(1080000000) giving 9460800000000 
kilometers per year. Using the distance in 
kilometers that light travels in a year, the 
distance of 27000 light years can be obtained
by multiplying 9460800000000 by 27000, 
resulting in a distance 255441600000000000 
kilometers. ]]; 

b) use your answer in a) and the fact that 
1AU = 1.5e8 km to figure out how far the Sun 
is from the galactic center in AU. (i.e. can 
think of it roughly as how many Sun-Earth 
system can be packed in between) 

[[ After finding the distance between the Sun 
and the galactic center to be 
255441600000000000 kilometers, this can be 
converted to AU by dividing by 150000000, 
resulting in a distance of 1702944000 AU. ]];  


--------------------------------------------

Problem 3 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
For a neutron star whose density is 5e17 
kg/m3,

a) what would the mass of 1 teaspoons worth of 
the material from that neutron star be? You 
can assume the volume of a standard teaspoon
to be 5e-6 m3. 

[[ The mass is proportional to the product of 
the density and given volume: (5e17)*(5e-6) = 
25e11 kg. ]]; 

b) how many empire state buildings (3.3e8 kg) 
would that be? 

[[ Given that the mass in a teaspoon is 25e11 
kg: (25e11)/(3.3e8) = 7575.75 empire state 
buildings. ]];  


--------------------------------------------

Problem 4 (4 points).
--------------------------------------------
In class we learned the difference between 
keeping track of time relative to distant 
stars and relative to the Sun, e.g. sidereal 
day vs. solar day. A tropical year has 365.2422
solar days and 366.2422 sidereal days.

a) What is the length of one sidereal day in 
terms of solar days?

[[ Given that there are 365.2422 solar days and
366.2422 sidereal days in a year, one sidereal
day equates to 365.2422/366.2422=0.9973 solar
days. ]]; 

b) If we know the average solar day is 24 hours
use your answer in a) to figure out the length
of one sidereal day in terms of hours, minutes
and seconds (in the format hh:mm:ss). 

[[ Knowing that the average solar day is 24 
hours: 24 = x/0.9973, x=23.9352hr. 60*0.9352 =
56.112min. 60*0.112 = 6.72sec. Thus, yielding 
23:56:07 for a sidereal day. ]]; 

c) Hypothetically, as part of a project to show
Jupiters apparent motion relative to distant
stars, you took a first photo of Jupiter one 
night at 9:00:00 pm. You want to take a second 
photo the very next night and have all the 
distant stars show up at the same positions in
your photo as the night before (with exactly
the same camera position and orientation), at
what time (in the format hh:mm:ss) should you
take the second photo? 

[[ Knowing 23:56:07 for a sidereal day, if a 
photo were taken at 21:00 of Jupiter with the 
desire of keeping the location of the distant 
stars the same, 23:56:07 would have to pass, 
making the time 08:56:07 p.m. ]];

Problem 5 (5 points).
--------------------------------------------
With the help of the diagram above, answer 
the following for the location of Hoboken 
(latitude = 41 deg): 

a) What is the angle between the zenith and 
the north celestial pole?

[[ An individuals latitude is the altitude of 
their respective celestial pole, so in Hoboken
(North Hemisphere), the North Celestial Pole 
is at an angle of 41o, and zenith is always at 
an angle of 90o. Thus, the angle between zenith
and the NCP is 49o in Hoboken. ]]; 

b) On the day of June solstice, when the sun is
the highest in your local sky, what is the 
angle between the sun and the zenith? 

[[ On the day of the June solstice, the sun is 
located 23.5o above the equator at its highest
point (noon). At solar noon, the zenith angle 
is at a minimum and is equal to latitude minus
solar declination angle, which is at its max on 
the summer solstice, at 23.5o. Thus, at a 
latitude of 41oN, the zenith angle is 41 - 23.5 
= 17.5o ]]; 

c) On the day of March equinox, when the sun is
the highest in your local sky, what is the angle
between the sun and the zenith? 

[[ The sun runs along the celestial equator 
during the March equinox, resulting in the 
zenith angle being equal to the latitude at 
solar noon, which means the angle in Hoboken 
would be 41o ]];

Problem 6 (2 points).
--------------------------------------------
a) What is so special about Polaris? Is it 
because it is the brightest star in the sky? 
If your answer is no, then explain why else 
Polaris is special. 

[[ Polaris as we know it today in the 21st 
century is special, but not because it is the 
brightest star in the sky. It is situated at 
the North Celestial Pole (NCP), with Earth’s
axis pointing directly at it. While it will 
not be situated there forever, it allows for 
us to easily keep track of where North is, 
simply by following Polaris. ]]; 

b) Was our north pole pointed at Polaris 
13000 years ago? If not, sketch out the 
orientation of the north pole relative to 
Polaris today and 13000 years ago. 

[[ No, the axis of rotation wobbles over 
time, causing it to point in different 
directions on different time intervals. 
Roughly 13,000 years ago, Vega was the north 
star, and in about 13,000 years, it will once 
again be the north star. ]]; 


-------------------------------------------- 

Problem 7 (1 point). 
--------------------------------------------
Do lunar eclipses happen every single month? 
Explain your answer. 

No, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon 
enters the Earths shadow. They do not happen 
every month because the Earth's orbit around 
the sun is not in the same plane as the Moons 
orbit around Earth

Problem 1 (5 points) 
--------------------------------------------
a) Whats the significance of the first 
supernova Tycho Brahe observed?  

[[ The first supernova not only challenged 
the old belief that the “heavenly skies” 
were permanent, perfect and fixed, but it 
effectively disproved the geocentric model 
touted by Aristotle and Ptolemy. ]]; 

b) Why didnt Tycho detect stellar parallax? 

[[ Stellar Parallax is defined as the 
apparent displacement of a nearby star as 
seen from an observer on Earth. Tycho 
Brahe’s existence was just before the first 
telescope was invented and used for 
celestial observation by Galileo Galilei. As 
a result of his observations of distant 
objects being done with the naked eye, his 
view was too far away for him to notice any 
parallax. ]]; 

c) Why do we sometimes see Mars moving 
backward in the sky? 

[[ Mars is farther away from the sun than 
Earth, which means it moves slower, allowing 
Earth to catch up to its orbital position, and 
pass it. Once the Earth passes Mars, Mars 
appears to be moving backwards; however, it is 
actually just an illusion that is viewed when 
the position of Mars is observed with respect 
to nearby constellations over the time that 
Earth catches up to and passes the orbital 
position of Mars. ]]; 

d) List at least 2 pieces of evidence ancient 
philosophers/astronomers used to support the 
Sun-centered model instead of the earth 
centered model as we discussed in class. 

[[ 
1. In relation to the previous question, the 
so-called “apparent retrograde” of Mars, or its 
apparent backward motion, is one of the concepts 
that imposed a challenge to the geocentric 
theory, favoring a heliocentric model where 
varying orbital planes could allow for such a 
perceived motion from Earth, developed by 
Copernicus. 

2. Using Tycho Brahes observational data, 
Johannes Kepler found an 8 arcminute variance 
between the observed data and a theoretical model 
composed of orbits that exhibited perfect circular 
patterns. Instead of ignoring this small error, 
Kepler analyzed the data, and ultimately found 
that planets have elliptical orbital patterns with 
respect to the sun. 

3. Galileos observations with a skyward facing 
telescope allowed him to explore various features 
of the nearby universe with a much better 
resolution. This included the rings of Saturn, 
Jupiters moons and the characteristics of the 
phases of Venus that can only be explained if it 
orbits the Sun not Earth. Through his observations 
with a better viewing resolution, the concept of 
Stellar Parallax was observed. These observations 
favored a heliocentric model that would support 
stellar parallax, as the observable position of 
stars would change as the Earths orbital position 
around the sun changed.

Problem 2 (3 points) 
--------------------------------------------
A planet is orbiting a star of 1 solar mass 
with an orbital period of 60 months. What is 
the semimajor axis of the planets orbit? 

[[ 
Using Kepler’s Third Law (Newtons Two-Body 
Problem can also be applied, more specifically 
if the star has a mass that is not equal to 1 
solar mass): p2=a3 where p = orbital period in 
years and a = the semimajor axis in AU (1 AU = 
1.5E8 km)

p = 60/12 = 5 years

Solve for a:

a=p2/3 =(5)2/3 =2.92AU or 438E6km

Problem 3 (6 points) 
--------------------------------------------
NASAs OSIRIS-REx mission is the first US 
mission to retrieve a sample from an asteroid 
(Bennu, mass 7.8e10 kg, radius 250 m) and 
return it to Earth. OSIRIS-REx was launched in 
2016, arrived at Bennu in 2018, and touched 
down on the asteroid on Oct. 20, 2020. Before 
the touchdown, OSIRIS-Rex was orbiting the 
asteroid at a height of 2.0 km above the 
surface of the asteroid. What was the orbital 
speed of the spacecraft in m/s? You can assume 
the asteroid is spherical and the orbit is 
perfectly circular. (Feel free to review the 
lecture slides/notes where we derived the 
expression for orbital speed.) 

[[ Using the concept of centripetal force, 
orbital speed can be obtained. 

Fc = (mv2)/r

Gravitational Force:

FG = (GMm)/(r2)

G = 6.67E-11 m3/kg*s2

To solve for orbital speed:
v = sqrt([GM]/r) when m <<<<<<<<< M
v = sqrt([(6.67E-11)(7.8E10)]/(2000+250)) 
v = 0.048 m/s ]]; 


--------------------------------------------

Problem 4 (8 points) 
--------------------------------------------
In class we discussed how to use 
conservation of energy to figure out escape 
speed, the initial speed needed for a 
“satellite” object to escape (i.e. speed 
reduces to 0 when it reaches infinity). 
Recall that the total orbital energy is the 
sum of kinetic energy (mv2 /2) and 
gravitational potential energy (−GMm/r).

Now, lets use the same method to figure out 
the “impact speed”. Imagine a meteorite 
heading towards Mars. If the meteorites 
speed is 0 when it’s infinitely far away 
from Mars, what would its speed be when 
it hits the surface of Mars?

You can think of it as the reverse of the 
“escape problem” discussed in class. List 
the initial kinetic energy and potential 
energy at infinity, as well as the final 
kinetic energy and potential energy at 
impact. And you might want to look up the 
radius and mass of Mars. 

[[ 
At infinity, v = 0 m/s (Escape velocity 
has been reached), so Kinetic Energy (KE) 
= (mv2)/2 = 0 At infinity, r = infinity, 
so Gravitational Potential Energy (UG) = 
-(GMm)/r = 0  

Conservation of energy can be used to 
represent the meteorite from infinity to 
the surface of Mars.

Ef -Ei =0
If Ei = 0 (At infinity) 
and Ef = (mv2)/2 - (GMm)/r 
(Sum of KE and U) 

Then (mv2)/2 - (GMm)/r = 0, 
so (mv2)/2 = (GMm)/r

The radius of Mars can be used as r, 
representing the radius at the moment of 
impact. According to NASA, the volumetric 
mean radius of Mars = 3389.5 km

From that data, the mass of Mars (M) = 
6.4169E23 kg

Since m is much smaller than M, it can be 
neglected.

By rearranging the equation to solve for v, 
we acquire the same equation that would be 
used to find the escape velocity, except a 
different radius is being used in this case.
v = sqrt([2GM]/r) = 
sqrt([2(6.67E-11)(6.4169E23)]/[3389.5E3]) = 
5025.42 m/s 
]];

Problem 5 (4 points) 
--------------------------------------------
If the surface of Earth on average has a 
temperature of 15oC, what is the wavelength 
(in nm) at which its blackbody radiation 
intensity is the highest? Which portion of the 
electromagnetic spectrum is it (e.g. visible, 
radio, etc.)? Hint: Wien’s law of blackbody 
radiation. Remember to convert the temperature 
into Kelvin.

[[
A blackbody represent an idealized object: 

—absorbs all photons that strike them; 
—does not let light escape easily.

Using Wien’s Law of Blackbody Radiation:

lmax = 2900000/(T [in Kelvin]) = 
2900000/(15 + 273.15) = 10064.20 = 
1.00642E4 nm 

This places it in the infrared range based on 
its wavelength.

Problem 6 (4 points) 
--------------------------------------------
In class we discussed the fundamental angular 
resolution limit of telescopes due to the 
wave nature of light. If you were to make an 
observation in the mm wavelength range (say 
centered at wavelength λ = 1 mm) with a 10 m 
telescope, what is the best angular 
resolution you can reach (in arcmin)? 

[[ 
Angular Resolution 
(In Radians) = 1.22(λ/D) = 1.22(0.001/10) = 
1.22E-4 rad 

Angular Resolution 
(In Arcsec) = 2.5E5(λ/D) = 
2.5E5(0.001/10) = 25 arcsec 

If there are 60 arcseconds in 1 arcminute:

Angular Resolution (In Arcmin) = 
(1/60)*(25) = 0.4167 arcmin 
]];
